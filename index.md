title: Hello

Currently living in Cape Town â€” possibly the most beautiful city in the world.
I'm the creator of the no-nonsense blogging platform, Bear, and a few other things.
I also write short-to-mid length essays about life, tech, and whatever I currently find interesting.

## Now
This year has started off really well. I'm back into a good rhythm of sleep, exercise, writing, spending time with people I love, and spending time alone. It's summer in Cape Town, which means more beach, mountains, and traffic.
