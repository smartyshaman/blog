## Hello, I'm Anant.

### I write words, ride bikes, climb mountains, and make things.

Currently living in Cape Town â€” possibly the most beautiful city in the world.

I'm the creator of the no-nonsense blogging platform, Bear, and a few other things.

I also write short-to-mid length essays about life, tech, and whatever I currently find interesting.
