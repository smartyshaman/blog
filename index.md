### Hello! I’m a software person who loves to make stuff.

I fell in love with code as a kid when I got my first BASIC program to run. Since then, I’ve spent my career writing software, writing about software, and leading software teams and companies.

I’m a former CEO, startup founder, and author. You can see my career path on LinkedIn, and some thoughts on life on Bluesky. Email me to my usual username at Gmail.

Thanks for stopping by.
