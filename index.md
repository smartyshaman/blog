## Hello, I'm Anant.

### I make videos, teach filmmaking, and occasionally pretend to be productive.

Based in Singapore, where it’s either blazing hot or pouring rain—sometimes both at the same time.

I spend my time geeking out over cameras, tinkering with AI, and figuring out how to balance being a dad, a YouTuber, and a guy who just wants to hit the gym without excuses.

Expect thoughts on tech, creativity, and whatever weird rabbit hole I’ve fallen into this week.
